== 3 Reasons to Embed NFT Galleries On Your Website ==

**1. Showcase Your Digital Art Collections**
With the digital art market constantly growing in value, showcasing your NFT collections somewhere other than on platforms like OpenSea becomes even more valuable. Be proud of the collection you're building and share it with the world.

**2. Grow Your Following**
Displaying an NFT gallery on your existing website does two things. First, convert existing site visitors into followers of your involvement in the NFT space. Second, get those who follow you on other platforms to visit your website and get them to be more personally involved.

**3. Attract Buyers**
NFTs are great investment opportunities, so adding a gallery to your website gives visitors the chance to browse your collection in one single location. With each NFT linking to its OpenSea page, it makes it super easy for people to make offers and buy your NFTs.

== What's Coming Next? ==

At RebelCode, we are constantly experimenting and [bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3](https://rebelcode.com/?p=2914). With the promise of digital ownership, we have been intrigued by the evolution of the web for over a decade, building tools focused on restoring ownership of our content across platforms.

The NFT Galleries is our first foray into creating tools for Web3, but it certainly won't be our last.

Aside from continuing to develop and grow this plugin, we have more projects in the works that you can follow on [our Playground](https://rebelcode.com/playground/).
